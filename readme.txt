== Description ==
Responsive Tabs is a fully responsive theme. It is visually elegant (Graphic design by Jane Winsor) and minimizes page weight for rapid response on all platforms. The theme was designed for politicians or organizations seeking to emphasize two-way communications with their constituents, but has broad use for any organization seeking a clean, attractive look and a clear content hierarchy. 

The design premise of the theme is that (a) less can be more visually -- users should be able to focus on what they came to see; (b) at the same time, it should be obvious where to find any content even on a site with a wide range of content.  

Major Design Features
+++ Tabbed design -- let the user know what the site contains without overwhelming them.  
+++ Great flexibility as to content under each tab based on standard widgets.
+++ Customizer interface to allow easy font and color changes.
+++ Elegant tiled approach for featuring favorite site content on the front page -- tiles for each favorite post will line up in rows of 4 in wide desktop view, but will reshuffle into rows of 3, 2 or 1 as the screenwidth decreases.
+++ Custom widgets for front page use -- post summaries with images, wide-format category and comment lists.
+++ Dropdown menu for the routine links like about, contact, etc. -- the things that users know to look for on every site.
+++ Footer accordion for standard reference content.
+++ Options for wide format pages and posts for tables and other wide format content.
+++ Standard plugin hooks with extra support for key plugins -- bbPress, popular Breadcrumb plugins, FrontEnd Post No Spam, Clippings.
+++ Scupulous attention to Wordpress design and coding standards to maximize compatibility and transparency.




== Installation ==
Setting up your tabbed front page is straightforward using Wordpress widgets.

1.	 Standard theme install -- install the theme files in a subdirectory called responsive-tabs in the wp-content/themes subdirectory.
2.  From the Wordpress administrative dashboard go to Appearance>Themes to activate Responsive Tabs.
3.  To set up your front page, enter the titles you want, separated by commas, in Appearance>Customize>Tab Titles, like so:
    Favorites, Latest Posts, Latest Comments
4.  You will see your new tabs momentarily in the customizer. Click on one and the Widget area for that Tab will show as a section in the customizer.
5.  Populate the widget and repeat for each tab.
6.  If you want people to land on something other than the left most tab (Tab 1), enter the number for that tab.
7.  Save Changes
8.  You can set all other theme options in Appearance>Customize.
--  Go to Appearance>Customize>Menu to select a menu to put in the Main Menu location that will appear in the left sidebar (in widescreen view) or under the drop down (in screens less than 1580 pixels wide).  Or go to Appearance>Menus to create a menu if you are starting from scratch.
--  Go to Appearance>Customize>Login Links in side menu to optionally append profile, dashboard and login/out links to the main menu.
7.  If you are not seeing your front page, check Appearance>Customize>Static Front Page -- make sure that it is set to Your Latest Posts. That setting will invoke the Responsive Tabs tabbed front page.  However, you can also choose A Static Page and that will bypass the Responsive Tabs front page.
8.  Check your site front page.  If you are happy with your front page tabs, return to Appearance>Front Page Options to configure the other options available there -- Accordions and Breadcrumbs.  If you are an experienced user, you can add custom CSS and scripts.
9.  Don't miss the option to set up Accordions in page footers for static reference materials -- Appearance>Footer Accordions.
10. Let us know if you have questions or concerns -- will@twowayconstituentcommunication.com
